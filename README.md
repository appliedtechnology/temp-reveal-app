- Get started for the first time:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:appliedtechnology/dnfs-material-slides.git
  cd dnfs-material-slides
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

- Once you have done that the first time you can just start the slides with:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- The starting point for the slides is <http://localhost:4000/>.

## Trying out v2

## Tips

- Hit O in the browser to get an overview of all slides in the slide deck
- Hit S in the browser to get to see the Speaker notes
- You can get a [printer friendly version](http://localhost:4000/?print-pdf), by clicking the rotated salt banner in the top left corner.
  - or by adding `?print-pdf` to the URL. Notice that that the `?print-pdf` needs to go before any `#`. So to print <http://localhost:4000/#/course-intro> write <http://localhost:4000/?print-pdf/#/course-intro> in the URL
  - Also notice that it will include all slide decks (for all days)
